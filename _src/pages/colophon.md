## Fonts

The main headlines of pages use [Lautsprecher DJR](https://djr.com/notes/lautsprecher-djr-font-of-the-month/). It’s a digital revival of a typeface drawn by Jakob Erbar. Erbar also drew the my personal first favorite font, [Erbar Grotesk](https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/7923/erbar-grotesk). But that’s a different story.

The sub headlines are set in [Bridge Head](https://www.typemates.com/fonts/bridge-head) Bold, accompanying the text font [Bridge Text](https://www.typemates.com/fonts/bridge-text). Bridge is a project by [Mona Franz](http://www.monafranz.de/portfolio/).

The image I use for the generic Open Graph/Twitter card/and so forth image has been taken from the book <cite>Gray lady and the birds; stories of the bird year for home and school</cite> and [posted on commons.wikimedia.com](<https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gray_lady_and_the_birds;_stories_of_the_bird_year_for_home_and_school_(1907)_(14752496571).jpg>).
