intro: A non-ordered list of music that got me through 2023, not necessarily released in 2023. What is time anyway?

A non-ordered, non-comprehensive list of music that got me through 2023, not necessarily released in 2023.

Expect everything from barely-anything-happening Ambient to peak-time rave hits, with a healthy dose of punk sprinkled in. Life’s too short to think in genres.

## Daughter – Stereo Mind Game

![""](/blog/music2023/daughter-stereo-mind-game.jpg)

When _Daughter_ released their first album in 2013, I was young(er), depressed, and a bit lost. Oh boy did they save me.

Since then they’ve been a stable in my heavy rotation. Their latest offering _Stereo Mind Game_ made it not only to the top of the rotation, but is – together with their debut _If You Leave_ – my favourite album of them. So, naturally, one of the albums that saved me in 2023.

## URTE - Parallel Heights

I discovered _URTE_ through _WARNING’s_ SoundCloud [when they premiered _Rave Kids 23_](https://soundcloud.com/warningberlin/new-hit-urte23). _Parallel Heights_ is on a level of its own. After the release I wasn’t able to listen to anything else for two weeks. My favourite track? All of them. They are so unique, really showcasing _URTE’s_ producer sensibilities.

## Pugilist – Negative Space

![""](/blog/music2023/pugilist-negative-space.jpg)

For some reason, the UK always been ahead on future sounds. _Pugilist’s_ latest outing on _Of Paradise_ follows in this tradition, effortlessly merging Bass Music, Dubstep, and Techno.

{% bandcampEmbed 2265679515 %}

## The Trip – UK Business

There’s nothing like a UK Garage bassline. Not-friends of the sound might remark that they all sound the same. Which, true. But _that’s the point_ of dance music. _The Trip_ offers a nice variety from the slightly cheesy _Big Buzz_ to the peak-time belter _Who got the Funk?_

{% bandcampEmbed 2824845045 %}

## Amen 81 – Musik aus der bayerischen Staatskanzlei

Say what you want about Bavaria, it does have its good things. Brezels and _Amen 81_, mostly. Returning to _My Ruin, Amen 81_ sound as fresh as ever, maybe even more so.

{% tidalEmbed 297348413 %}

## Naone – WAR1208

![""](/blog/music2023/naone-war1208.jpg)

Depending on who you ask, dance music might have a trance problem. At times I tend to agree, but other times there are EPs such as these on the ever-reliant _WARNING_ label. Shut up and dance with me.

{% bandcampEmbed 3832947276 %}

## Gray Acres – Dreams and Phantoms

I’m easily impressed when it comes to Ambient. The less happening, the better. _Gray Acre’s Dreams and Phantoms_ packs a whole lot into not that much. It’s just a wonderful release to calm you down.

{% bandcampEmbed 3067848923 %}

## Vertical67 – Shades of Acid

Acid is a weird thing. It sounds like noise, but at the same time it’s one of the best elements ever added to House and Techno. _Vertical67_ took this, applied various shades to it on all of the tracks of this EP and it’s good. Especially Woozy is such a banger.

{% bandcampEmbed 1134960846 %}

## Desert Sound Colony – Infinite Strikes EP

I digged this record in some shop, and while I thought it is quite weird music, I also recognised that _Another Fish in the Pan_ is a belter of a track that will at one point make a dance floor lose its collective mind. I’m so glad to own this. It’s a pure joy track. Take no prisoners, take ecstasy.

{% bandcampEmbed 2720276830 %}

## Charlotte Day Wilson – ALPHA

![""](/blog/music2023/cdw-alpha.jpg)

Back to pop music and some melancholy. _Charlotte Day Wilson_ saved my heart this summer, when it lay on the ground broken through a love lost. She does it with more grace and feels than most.

{% bandcampEmbed 2693551446 %}

## Accented Measures – Space Drift EP

Ace House Music somewhere between Deep and Tech House. Don’t know, don’t care. Once the acid line in _Bad Sectors_ hits, you’ll find me front row.

{% bandcampEmbed 937361868 %}

## Loscil & Lawerence English – Colours of Air

How many colours are there in an air? Enough to compose an entire ambient album around it. Lucky for us. The signal to noise ratio would be much worse without it.

{% bandcampEmbed 2688766583 %}

## Syndrome 81 – Prisons Imaginaire

![""](/blog/music2023/syndrome81-prisons-imaginaire.jpg)

If you’d have asked if I’d consider listening to Oi! punk, my response would be a resounding «No». How foolish! It turns out there is a whole movement in France combining elements of Oi! and New Wave. Thanks to J. for recommending this to me.

{% bandcampEmbed 4097403679 %}

## Morphology – Lakeland Dubs EP

Let me put it simply: Merging Electro and Dub Techno is a genius idea, perfectly executed by _Morphology_, who seldom miss an opportunity to put out excellence.

{% bandcampEmbed 3545300524 %}

## Fotokiller – Eerie Nostalgia

![""](/blog/music2023/fotokiller-eerie-nostalgia.jpg)

If you need one album to listen to when walking through a gloomy night when everyone else is asleep, look no further than _Eerie Nostalgia_. While heavily citing late-80s Wave Punk, it sounds fresh. Bonus points for _Fotokiller_ being an a+ live band.

{% bandcampEmbed 1595925949 %}

## Die Verlierer – s/t

![""](/blog/music2023/die-verlierer.jpg)

Let’s stay with guitar heavy music for a moment. _Die Verlierer’s_ self-titled album was released on the ever-reliable _Mangel Records_. Like Fotokiller, Die Verlierer are indebted to 80s sound, and equally like them they make it sound fresh as hell.

{% bandcampEmbed 437061264 %}

## Splizz – s/t

Punk rock to [stay at home to](https://splizz.bandcamp.com/track/nichtstun).

{% bandcampEmbed 1457551481 %}

## Black Light Smoke – Ghosts

This was released very close to my birthday and I couldn’t have thought of a better gift. _Black Light Smoke_ already produced _[Firefly](https://blacklightsmoke.bandcamp.com/track/firefly-2)_, one of my all time favourite moody house tracks.

With _Ghosts_ he returns to House Music after a stint in the darker sides of dance music. It opens with a Sprinkles speech on culture under capitalism. Instant win. It stays strong after this, too. Stripped down, moody House Music just the way it needs to be.

{% bandcampEmbed 4022304149 %}

## Promising/Youngster – Bernesga EP

![""](/blog/music2023/promisingyoungster-bernesga.jpg)

Released on _Analogical Force_ who – for me – sometimes trip over the edge of acceptable weirdness, this one sits perfectly in the center of soundscapes you want to listen and dance – or fly to another galaxy – to.

{% bandcampEmbed 3087903592 %}

## Altinbas – Second Wind

I neglected Techno for quite a while. I felt that it got boring. So, when asked if I want to do a Techno podcast I hesitated at first. But when I started digging I was pleasantly surprised to discover that Techno got interesting again. Prime example for this is _Altinbas’_ latest string of releases.

{% bandcampEmbed 2030665679 %}

## Holden Federico – Inner Order

Another very strong example of my new found love for Techno is _Holden Federico_ EP on _SK\_eleven’s_ excellent _SK X_ series. Eerie ambiance, paired with tight percussion patterns. What’s not to like.

{% bandcampEmbed 1426412177 %}

## VC-118A – Waves of Change

![""](/blog/music2023/vc118a-waves.jpg)

_VC-118A_ returned to _Delsin_ offering his typical in-depth excursions floating somewhere between Ambient, Dub and Electro. Samuel van Dijk is second to none in crafting sounds through which the outer world disappears while one is fully submerged in them.

{% bandcampEmbed 74176690 %}

## Hania Rani – Ghosts

![""](/blog/music2023/hania-rani-ghosts.jpg)

Yes, I do have an affinity for ghosts and ghosts themed music. I also really like _Hania Rani’s_ music. [_Home_](https://haniarani.bandcamp.com/album/home) saved my sanity during the darker times of the COVID-19 pandemic. With _Ghosts_ she returns to _Gondwana Records_. It’s audible that her approach to music has changed and expanded. Still rooted in her piano skills, it incorporates more electronic elements and vocals.

{% bandcampEmbed 3090488752 %}

## Low Tape – Escape from Road Valley

Another one from the acidic depths of Electro music. Space-flight stuff galore. Just leave me in the vicinity of the Virgo Supercluster, I’ll find my way back home. _Eudemonia’s_ recent run of releases has been excellent.

{% bandcampEmbed 3953022565 %}

## Joe Davis – Shields in Full Sunlight

![""](/blog/music2023/joe-davis-sunlight.jpg)

_Smallville_ never disappoints. I can think of few labels that keep such a consistent level over 70+ releases. The first _Smallpeople_ album firmly sits in my lifetime top 10 dance music albums. Naturally I was stoked when I saw Joe Davis’ album announced and it does everything it needs to do. Some samples, moody synths, sunlight baked into beats.

{% bandcampEmbed 4159481379 %}

## Various Artists – EEPPIICC002

I’m still a bit speechless how ridicolously good this _Strike a Pose_ edit is. It, ahem, strikes right into the pop-affiliated 90s revival trend, but does so with humour _and_ style. Every winter needs its summer hit. This is mine.

{% bandcampEmbed 2332428118 %}

## Bersarin Quartett – Systeme

Another one of those artists whose output I follow very closely and since years. [_Mehr als alles andere_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcoBaAACqJY) is in close contention to be one of my most listened songs ever. _Systeme_ has just been released and fits _Bersarin Quartett’s_ «slightly unsettling with sparks of optimism» schema perfectly.

A good year in music paired with a weird year, personally, and a catastrophe, overall. Will 2024 improve on those scales? Unfortunately, we’ll find out. Fortunately, we’ll have more music to survive another year.
