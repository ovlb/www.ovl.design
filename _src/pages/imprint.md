## Disclaimer of Liability

I try to keep everything on the site good-looking and up-to-date. It is my site at least. Nonetheless, content may—to be honest: will—become outdated, links will stop working. This kind of stuff. If this happens, I apologise in any form, but haven’t promised anything in the first place. Also, I sometimes link to content I can not endorse, sometimes I link to content I can endorse. But this also may change. In which case I am sad.

## Data Protection

It is rather easy: I do not use any kind of tracking technology and hereby promise to not change this. It is not of my interest what you do on the web or on this site. But, if I could ask for one favour: if anything is broken, please send me an e-mail or open an issue in [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/ovlb/www.ovl.design).

This site does not feature a contact form. Which means: I also do not save data from a contact form. Who would have thought! If you send me an e-mail, it will be saved on Proton Mail’s servers, as this is where I host them. All mails are encrypted at rest. You can visit [Proton’s privacy site](https://proton.me/legal/privacy) to learn how they process data stored on their servers.

And, finally: This site is deployed and hosted with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). I do use their [server side analytics](https://www.netlify.com/products/analytics/). Those do not show any personal information. To know everything about their handling of data, please refer to [Netlify’s privacy page](https://www.netlify.com/privacy/).

I think that’s all. Happy browsing.
