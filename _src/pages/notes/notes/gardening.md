I deeply love the metaphor of the [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).

So this website shall become one. This is a loose collection of development notes.

## Taxonomy

Text starts as a note. From there it is free to move around the site. Or stay as a note, thatâ€™s finished â€“ for now. 11tyâ€™s data deep merge makes this very simple. The posts are Markdown file. While in the notes folder, they automatically get the `notes` tag and and up in `collections.notes`.

Once I think a note isnâ€™t a note anymore, I might add it to the text folder. It can be a draft, or immediately published. As everything Markdown, I only need to add a bit more front data, to accomodate for the slightly more refined design of fully fledged articles.

All posts on this website use a common theme for categories, they are tags (so that they get picked up by 11tyâ€™s collection feature), prefixed by `cat:`. This global taxonomy allows me to link newsletter issues, notes, and articles which share a common theme.

- Re-use `cat:xyz` tags from Around the Web, aggregate all content based on these
- Use tags for further reading underneaths posts instead of (or in addition to?) previous/next

## Content

- How to keep Ulysses and the git repo in sync?
- Migrate away from Contentful, this should be the fast part

## Dev & Design

- Automatically generate redirect file to move files/states freely
- Unify `og:image`s during build with 11ty img
- Can I use DeepLâ€™s API for auto-generating localised content?
