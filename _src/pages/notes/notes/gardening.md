I deeply love the metaphor of the [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).

So this website shall become one. This is a loose collection of development notes.

## Taxonomy

Text starts as a note. From there it is free to move around the site. Or stay as a note, thatâ€™s finished â€“ for now. 11tyâ€™s data deep merge makes this very simple. The posts are Markdown file. While in the notes folder, they automatically get the `notes` tag and and up in `collections.notes`.

Once I think a note isnâ€™t a note anymore, I might add it to the text folder. It can be a draft, or immediately published. As everything is Markdown, I only need to add a bit more frontmatter data, to accomodate for the slightly more refined design of fully fledged articles.

All posts on this website use a common theme for categories, they are tags (so that they get picked up by 11tyâ€™s collection feature), prefixed by `cat:`. This global taxonomy allows me to link newsletter issues, notes, and articles which share a common theme.

### Adding a bit of everything

While thatâ€™s certainly useful, how about building something really useless with this? Â«OhÂ», I hear you say, Â«you are speaking about chaos?Â» Yes, I am. So I built [Everything](/everything/). Itâ€™s a randomly sorted page of, well, all pages. At its end it contains every category I use in this website, which is page of all posts in this category â€“ random, of course.

### Better read more

- Use tags for further reading underneaths posts instead of (or in addition to?) previous/next

## Content

When starting this note I wrote: Â«Migrate away from Contentful, this should be the fast partÂ». Well. It wasnâ€™t. Copying everything went well. But then my build was inventing HTML tags in the output path of completely unrelated pages. It was mayhem.

## Dev & Design

- Automatically generate redirect file to move files/states freely
- Unify `og:image`s during build with 11ty img
- Can I use DeepLâ€™s API for auto-generating localised content?
