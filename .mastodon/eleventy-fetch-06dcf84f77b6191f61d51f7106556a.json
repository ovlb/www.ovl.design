On the canvas, an artwork of mine ( \"A witch of Magmah\" sources on peppercarrot.com, artworks category ) . The video show how I use the selection tool around a finger of the character, and duplicate it. A little paint-over, and you have a hand with 6 fingers.\n\nIf you don't get it: here some background. My art is part of many AI dataset without my consent. The AI have issue to denoise statistically the area containing fingers, and it result often into characters with problems into fingers. By adding a new finger at the source of the datasets, I'm expecting a huge sabotage in the learning of the correct amount of finger in illustration :-P\n\nNote: It's a joke.","blurhash":"UUINgR~90$4p57M}s,%L57M|%1tQtRX8o0so"}],"mentions":[],"tags":[],"emojis":[],"card":null,"poll":null}
